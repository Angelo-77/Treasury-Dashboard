## 📊 Final Business Analyst Report – Treasury Project (Fiscal Year 2024)

## 📌 Executive Summary

The fiscal year 2024 presented critical insights into the company’s **Accounts Receivable (AR)** and **Accounts Payable (AP)** management. Through detailed KPI monitoring and financial statement analysis, we've identified areas of operational strength and urgent opportunities for improvement within the **financial cycle**.

---

## 📈 Accounts Receivable (AR) Analysis – FY 2024

### 🚨 Performance Against Goal
- **Achievement**: Only **60%** of the expected target was reached.
- **Implication**: This considerable gap reflects **underperformance in sales revenue**, demanding **urgent commercial strategies** such as enhanced marketing campaigns, promotional offers, and customer acquisition efforts.

### 💵 Cash Collected
- **Decrease of 4%** YoY.
- **Implication**: A decline in liquidity despite increasing credit sales highlights a **dangerous cash trap**—money is left on the table, limiting our ability to **invest in growth and innovation**.

### 🧾 Credit Sales vs. Cash Sales
- Credit sales have **increased**, putting additional pressure on cash flow.
- **Strategic Risk**: A growing imbalance between cash inflows and outflows negatively impacts the **Financial Operating Cycle**, particularly if AP terms remain short.

### 🕒 DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)
- DSO increased **76% YoY**.
- **Implication**: Customers are taking significantly longer to pay. This points to **ineffective credit control policies** and demands a reassessment of:
  - **Receivables policies**
  - **Customer credit risk segmentation**
  - **Collections process**
  - **Provisioning for Doubtful Accounts**

---

## 🧾 Accounts Payable (AP) Analysis – FY 2024

### 📉 Goal Management
- **Performance**: Stayed **5% below target**, which indicates a **positive cost containment strategy**.
- **Insight**: Expense controls were well-executed, even with increased revenue—showing maturity in **financial discipline**.

### 📦 Purchasing Trends
- Despite revenue growth, **total purchasing decreased**.
- **Interpretation**: Strong evidence of **cost efficiency** and optimal inventory or supplier management.

### 💰 AP Balance
- **Reduced by ~6%** during the year.
- Indicates improved **cash flow management** and a focus on reducing short-term liabilities without jeopardizing operations.

---

## 🔍 Treasury Alignment – Cash Flow vs. Outstanding Balances

### 📊 End-of-Year Mismatch
- **Net Treasury Position**: A **-32M cash flow** difference due to over-expenditure in the final quarter.
- **Implication**:
  - Reinforces the need for tighter **receivables recovery policies**.
  - Suggests a potential review of **bad debt provisioning practices**.
  - Highlights timing issues between **incoming receivables** and **outgoing payments**, undermining liquidity planning.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Revamp AR Strategy**:
   - Implement **stricter payment terms** and automated reminders.
   - Introduce **customer credit scoring** and incentivize early payments.
   - Monitor and update **provision for doubtful debts** quarterly.

2. **Sales & Marketing Activation**:
   - Launch initiatives to **boost revenue** while ensuring payment enforceability.
   - Consider **factoring or receivables financing** as interim solutions.

3. **Cash Flow Forecasting**:
   - Apply dynamic cash flow models to anticipate mismatches.
   - Integrate **dashboards for real-time liquidity tracking**.

4. **Leverage AP Strength**:
   - Negotiate **longer payment terms** with suppliers.
   - Use strong AP performance as leverage in contract renegotiations.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The company’s **AP strategy is commendable**, reflecting solid financial discipline and supplier relationship management. However, the **AR function represents a significant risk** to sustainable growth due to deteriorating cash conversion and excessive reliance on credit sales. 

A strategic realignment is required to safeguard liquidity, improve working capital turnover, and enable investment in future growth initiatives.
